## Answers to the Questions in Homework 4

* According to RSAT, the graph1 SAT with 3 colors is unsatisfiable.

* With 4 colors, the problem becomes satisfiable.

* These answers tell us at least 4 colors are needed to color everything. The output of RSAT is as follows:

v -1 -2 -3 4 -5 -6 7 -8 -9 10 -11 -12 -13 -14 15 -16 17 -18 -19 -20 -21 22 -23 -24 25 -26 -27 -28 0

Assuming colors go {red, green, blue, pink}, this means the following coloring works:

1, pink
2, blue
3, green
4, blue
5, red
6, green
7, red

* 8 colors are needed to satisfy graph2's SAT problem
